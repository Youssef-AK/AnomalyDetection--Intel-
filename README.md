# AnomalyDetection-Intel-


Learn how to use statistics and machine learning to detect anomalies in data. 
As a fundamental part of data science and AI theory, the study and application of how to identify abnormal data can be applied to supervised learning,
data analytics, financial prediction, and many more industries.
Understanding the theory and intuition behind these methods is an essential part of the modern developer's and researcherâ€™s tools and knowledge base.

## skills:

    The theory and methods used for anomaly detection from beginning to advanced levels
    Derive depth-based and proximity-based detection models
    Use many types of data from real-time streaming to high-dimensional abstractions
    Implement these types of models using a collection of Python* labs
